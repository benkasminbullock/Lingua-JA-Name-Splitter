=head1 NAME

Lingua::JA::Name::Splitter - split a Japanese name into given and family

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::JA::Name::Splitter 'split_kanji_name';
    my ($family, $given) = split_kanji_name ('風太郎');
    # Now $family = 風 and $given = 太郎.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module attempts to split the names of Japanese people into given
and family names. 

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 split_kanji_name

    my ($family, $given) = split_kanji_name ('渡辺純子');
    # Now $family = 渡辺 and $given = 純子

Native Japanese writing does not use spaces, so names appear as a
string of characters with no break. This function provides a
"guesswork" solution for dealing with names. It is a rough guess based
on a simple algorithm, and thus is suitable for those who need to deal
with large numbers of names quickly. Its output is not reliable, and
must be checked by a human.

The heuristic methods used are as follows. The first character is
assumed to be the family name's, and the last character is assumed to
be the given name's. When there are more than two characters in the
name, hiragana are assumed part of the given name. Kanji characters
are weighted by distance from the beginning of the name. A dictionary
of probabilities of family or given name kanji is also used to weight
some characters. The name is then split at the first character which
seems more likely to be part of the given name.

=head2 split_romaji_name

    my ($first, $last) = split_romaji_name ('KATSU, Shintaro');
    # $first = Shintaro, $last = Katsu
    my ($first, $last) = split_romaji_name ('Risa Yoshiki');
    # $first = Risa, $last = Yoshiki

Given a string containing a name of a Japanese person in romanized
form, guess which part is the first and which part is the last name
using the spaces, capitalization and commas in the name.

Japanese people write their names in a variety of romanized formats,
such as I<"KATSU, Shintaro">, I<"Shintaro Katsu">, I<"KATSU
Shintaro">, or even I<"ShintaroKATSU">. This function is intended as a
"rock breaker" for processing a large number of Japanese names in
romanized form. Its output needs to be checked by a human.

The dictionary of data used to make the names is taken from Enamdict,

script which makes the dictionary, F<enamdict-counter.pl>, is in the

itself.
